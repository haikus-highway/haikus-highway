Definition of haiku:
a Japanese poem of seventeen syllables, in three lines of five, seven, and five, traditionally evoking images of the natural world.

Example of a haiku:
An old silent pond...               (5 syllables)
A frog jumps into the pond,         (7 syllables)
splash! Silence again.              (5 syllables)

(1) Beginning of state object
    Definition of state: React components have a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

(2) Word typed in by user will be stored in our app here

(3) firstLine will be an array of objects that represents each word in our first line
      Each object in this array will contain 2 properties:
        (1) The word written
        (2) The number of syllables of the word written
      The same applies to secondLine and thirdLine

(4) This function will run when the form is submitted by user

(5) First AXIOS call (call to our API)
      Goal of this call: We want to find out the number of syllables in our userInput (this.state.userInput)

(6) Create an array that is a copy of our firstLine state property (this.state.firstLine)
        Copy is necessary because we cannot manipulate state directly without using the function .setState()

(7) We are adding an object into our firstLineCopy array
    This object will contain 2 properties:
    (1) The word written
    (2) The number of syllables of the word written

(8) Using our newly updated firstLineCopy array, we want to update our firstLine array in our state (this.state.firstLine)

(9) Once our state is updated, call the getRelatedWords() function
          This function takes a parameter = 'word'
          We will pass in userInput as an argument to this function
          The getRelatedWords function will grab us a list of words related to our word passed in (in this case, our word is this.state.userInput)

(10) This function will run an AXIOS call that gets data related to the word passed in
    Takes in one parameter = 'word'

(11) Recall: response = data received from AXIOS call
      What is the response?
        The response is a set of data returned from our API that contains words related to the word passed into the getRelatedWords() function 
      What do we want to do with the response?
        We want to filter this data based on the number of syllables in each word

(12) This filtering is done in the filterResults() function, so we must call it (line 90)

(13) This function will take in a parameter called 'results', which is an array
    'results' represents the data response received from our second AXIOS call (line 78)

(14) Represents the sum of the syllables of each word in our firstLine object
Example: If firstLine = [first, line, hello], then totalSyllablesSoFar = 4

(15) Represents the maximum number of syllables our added word can have
    Recall: The first line of a haiku MUST have 5 syllables

(16) Goal: we want to populate the first line of our haiku with words, however those words must not take up more than 5 syllables
    We want to create an array from our API data array ('results') that does NOT contain words that have syllables that will add to > 5

(17) If the number of syllables in the word in our API data <= the maximum number of syllables our word can have (so that the total does not exceed 5), add the item to our filtered array
